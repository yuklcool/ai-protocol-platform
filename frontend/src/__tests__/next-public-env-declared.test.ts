/**
 * Every NEXT_PUBLIC_* the app reads must be declared in frontend/Dockerfile.
 *
 * Regression (2026-08-05): the read-aloud (TTS) button never appeared on any
 * deployed env. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_READ_ALOUD` was set in frontend/.env.local
 * only, so it worked locally and was **compiled out** of every deployed bundle.
 * Nothing failed: the backend served a valid voice config and
 * /api/voice/config reported `enabled: true` — the button simply didn't exist.
 *
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_* is inlined at COMPILE time, and Docker silently ignores a
 * --build-arg for an ARG it doesn't declare, so this whole class fails as
 * "feature quietly absent in prod", never as a build error. A static check is
 * the only thing that catches it before a user does.
