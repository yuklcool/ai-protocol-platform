// v6.16.0 Phase 3: grouped into FIVE task-shaped areas instead of seven cards,
// one per API surface. The old layout mirrored the backend's module structure,
// which answers questions an operator never asks ("what is in tool_permissions?")
// while hiding the one they do ("what do my users actually see?").
//
// v6.16.0: gated by GET /api/admin/whoami (the role probe) instead of probing
// GET /api/admin/clients. The old probe was platform-only, so a legitimate
// tenant admin was told "admins only" on their own admin console. whoami also
// distinguishes "not an admin" from "the backend is down", which the old
// non-ok-means-forbidden read could not.
