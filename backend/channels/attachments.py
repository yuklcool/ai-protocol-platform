"""Channel attachment pipeline.

Mirrors the document upload flow (`backend/tools/documents/upload.py`)
but for files arriving via channel webhooks instead of `multipart/form-data`
from the web UI. Channel attachments become user documents — so a PDF
emailed to the bot lands in the user's document library and the AI can
reference it the same way it references web-uploaded files.

Why the same destination as web uploads:
    - Email + Drive + chat attachments all serve the same use case
      ("AI, look at this file"). One library, one parse pipeline.
    - Forks that want session-only ephemeral artifacts can override
      `AttachmentPipeline._save_to_documents` to route elsewhere.

The pipeline is intentionally minimal in v1:
    - Size guard (per-channel `max_size` from `BaseChannel.max_attachment_size`)
    - Extension allowlist (delegates to `_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` below)
    - Download from the channel-supplied URL
    - Upload to GCS at `users/{uid}/docs/channel/{uuid}-{filename}`
    - Pending-state Firestore record so the file is visible in the
      user's library immediately
    - Background AILANG Parse trigger (best-effort; failure logged, not
      blocking)
