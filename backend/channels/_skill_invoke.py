"""Bridge from channel webhook to `process_skill_request`.

Channels arrive at this layer with a Firebase UID (from
`IdentityResolver`) and a normalised `InboundMessage`. This module:

  1. Synthesises a minimal `User` + `AccessContext` (no JWT involved —
     identity already verified by the channel's webhook signature)
  2. Calls `skills.skill_processor.process_skill_request`
  3. Exposes the resulting AG-UI event stream two ways

There are two entry points over ONE underlying event stream:

  - `stream_skill_events` — yields raw AG-UI events. Streaming adapters
    (`supports_streaming = True`) consume these and render progressively.
  - `invoke_skill_collected` — folds the same stream into one string for
    collect-then-send adapters.

Both fold errors the same way, via `collect_reply`, so a `RUN_ERROR` is
user-visible on EVERY channel rather than being silently dropped (the
`"(no response)"` bug: a model outage and an empty answer were
indistinguishable). See `docs/design/v6.21.0/channels-agui-convergence.md`.
