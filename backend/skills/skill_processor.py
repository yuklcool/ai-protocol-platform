"""Skill request processor — orchestrates a single user turn.

Replaces v5's `process_assistant_request()` with an ADK-native flow:

  1. Look up the skill config; 404 if missing *or* not visible to the caller
     (existence leak prevented).
  2. Build a per-user LlmAgent via `adk.agent.create_agent_with_thinking`.
     The heuristic router picks `fast` vs `thinking` from the user message.
  3. Wrap the agent with `ag_ui_adk.ADKAgent`, using the shared singleton
     session service from `adk.session.get_session_service()` so sessions
     persist across requests within the same process.
  4. Construct an AG-UI `RunAgentInput` and yield each translated event
     as a dict.

Deliberately kept thin — the SSE endpoint owns auth, response shaping,
and header handling; this module just produces the event stream.
