"""Bundled write-and-run endpoint for A2UI surface actions (ACTION-TRIGGER M1).

Sibling of ``a2ui_surface_action_routes`` — same 7-gate access policy
(reused via ``_a2ui_surface_shared``) plus one extra opt-in gate, plus
synthetic agent invocation that streams AG-UI events back as SSE.

Closes the loop that the original ``surface-action`` endpoint left
open: today, a click persists the action into session state and waits
for the *next chat message* to trigger an agent turn. For Pattern 1
demos (declarative agent-driven UI — no chat composer) that's a
missing rung. This endpoint bundles write + run so a single click
drives a full turn, end-to-end, without any user-typed message.

See ``docs/design/v6.1.0/action-triggered-agent-turn.md`` for the
design rationale, the 8 gates, and the wire contract.

Auth + access boundary (eight gates):
  1-7. Identical to ``surface-action`` (shared via
       ``_a2ui_surface_shared``).
  8.   Skill must explicitly opt in via
       ``tool_configs.a2ui.allow_action_triggered_runs: true``
       (default false). Distinct trust grant from
       ``allow_surface_context_writes`` — a skill can accept action
       writes without being invokable by them.

The synthetic run input:
  * ``thread_id = session_id`` (AG-UI thread-id-as-session-id convention)
  * ``messages = []`` — no user-visible message; ``ADKAgent.run()`` at
    line 840 of the vendored ``ag_ui_adk`` accepts empty messages and
    falls through to ``_start_new_execution``
  * ``state = {"a2ui_action_trigger": {...}, "a2ui_surface_state": {...}}``
    so the wrapped ``wrap_with_a2ui_surface_context`` InstructionProvider
    can prepend the "user just clicked" framing clause
  * ``forwarded_props`` mirrors the same payload (belt-and-braces; the
    vendored library currently only reads ``state`` but the spec puts
    transient signals on ``forwarded_props``)

Responses:
  * 200 — SSE stream of AG-UI events, ``RUN_STARTED`` first, terminal
    ``RUN_FINISHED`` / ``RUN_ERROR`` last (G41 dedup ensures at most
    one terminal event per run)
  * 401/403/404/413 — same shape as ``surface-action``
  * 403 (new) — skill not opted into action-triggered runs
