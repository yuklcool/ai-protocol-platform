"""Platform-wide agent configuration (v6.14.0).

A single, admin-editable document that shapes EVERY skill's agent prompt. Today it
carries one thing: a platform ``preamble`` — shared identity / house-style /
guardrails that is PREPENDED to each skill's own instructions (see
``adk.platform_preamble_context``). It is the one place to say "you are part of
Aitana; here is how we behave" without editing every SKILL.md.

Stored as a singleton in the Firestore ``platform_config`` collection (doc id
``PLATFORM_CONFIG_DOC_ID``). Read on the hot request path via a TTL-cached loader
(``config.platform_config``), written only through the ``aitana-admin`` gated
admin route. When the doc is absent the loader returns a code default, so a fresh
env has a sensible preamble before any admin touches it.

The ``preamble`` is length-capped: it rides into every prompt on every turn, so an
unbounded value would bloat TTFT and token cost for the whole platform.
