"""FastAPI router for /api/admin/* endpoints.

The seed endpoint is gated by `_assert_caller_is_service_account` (Google
ID token + SA email allowlist) — it exists to support Cloud Build deploy hooks
and ops runbooks, never end users.

`GET /whoami` is different by design: it is the *role probe* the frontend uses
to decide whether to show the Admin surface at all, so it answers for any
authenticated user rather than 403-ing.
