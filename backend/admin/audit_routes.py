"""GET /api/admin/audit — read the admin audit trail (v6.16.0 Phase 4).

The trail has been written since v6.9.0 and readable by nobody: records
accumulated in ``admin_audit`` and were reachable only via raw Firestore. An
audit trail the admin it concerns cannot read does not discharge the
accountability promise that justified building it — especially once client-side
tenant admins are operating their own tenant.

Tenant-scoped: a tenant admin sees actions explicitly attributed to their stable tenant; a
platform admin sees everything. Read-only, so no audit row is written for
reading — consistent with ``access_routes`` (the trail is for changes; this is
an inspection).
