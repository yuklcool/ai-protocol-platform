        implied by "full conversations", but worth knowing.

    The tenant boundary itself is unchanged: ``assert_may`` still refuses a

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reconcile — v6.23.0 B5/F5/F6 Phase 1 (MEASUREMENT, not a fix)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# "Admin traces not populating correctly for some sessions" (Mark, during the
# 2026-08-06 UAT demo). The root cause is genuinely unknown, and the design doc
# (docs/design/v6.23.0/trace-completeness-and-access.md) is explicit that Phase 2
# must NOT be designed before this measures what is actually missing.
#
# A session's truth is spread over three stores that can each drift:
#
#   1. CANONICAL  — ADK's session events (Vertex Agent Engine). Ground truth.
#   2. MIRROR     — Firestore `chat_sessions/{id}`. Metadata ONLY; it holds no
#                   messages. It is written from three different places
#                   (bootstrap, first turn, the session-tracker callback), one of
#                   which swallows a canonical-create failure, and its turnCount
#                   is debounced — so it legitimately lags and can outlive the
#                   canonical session entirely.
#   3. TRACE      — what the admin endpoint above actually renders, i.e. the
#                   canonical events after `_events_to_*` reconstruction.
#
# Reporting "what is in one and absent from another" needs all three read in the
# same breath, and two of them are backend-only (Firestore + the session
# service). So the reconcile runs HERE and the CLI renders the result — one
# authenticated admin call rather than the CLI stitching three, one of which
# would be the ADK-native route that is now admin-gated anyway (SEC-1).
#
# Findings are CODES, not prose: the point of Phase 1 is to run this across many
# sessions and count which codes dominate. That distribution is what Phase 2 gets
# designed against.
