# --- ADK-native route guard (SECURITY, 2026-08-07) -------------------------
#
# `get_fast_api_app(web=True, …)` mounts ADK's own routes — /apps/…, /run,
# /run_sse, /debug/trace/…, /dev-ui, /builder/… — and NONE of them carry our
# `Depends(get_current_user)`. Our proxy (frontend/src/app/api/proxy/[...path])
# is a deliberate catch-all that forwards any path and relies entirely on the
# backend to authenticate, so on a deployed env those routes were reachable
# from the public internet with no token at all. Measured 2026-08-07 on dev,
# test and test.yourcompany.com: `/api/proxy/api/skills` → 401 (correct) while
# `/api/proxy/apps/aitana_platform/users/{uid}/sessions` → 200.
#
# What that exposed: a session's full event list (every message, tool call and
# extracted clause — i.e. ONE's contract content, exactly what CLAUDE.md's
# security rule governs), its artifacts (parsed documents), DELETE on a
# session, PATCH on user memory, and /run + /run_sse, which EXECUTE the agent
# and bill for it. A Firebase uid is not a secret — it appears in URLs, logs
# and admin surfaces — so obscurity was never the boundary.
#
# This is middleware rather than per-route dependencies on purpose: the routes
# are registered by ADK, so we cannot decorate them, and a future `google-adk`
# bump that adds a route would silently reopen the hole. Middleware denies by
# path prefix, so new ADK routes are covered the day they appear.
#
# Auth reuses the app's real entry point (`get_current_user` → the same
# Firebase / group-auth / LOCAL_MODE dispatch every other route uses) plus
# `resolve_admin_scope`, so an admin token keeps working — including the
# `aitana-adk-testing` skill's token-mint recipe — and LOCAL_MODE dev is
# unaffected. Note the ADK dev UI / playground now needs an admin token too.

# LIVE route table so an ADK-added route that escapes the prefixes fails CI

         mirrors backend STATE_SNAPSHOT events into ``agent.state`` and

         after turn N, the client sends turn N's state back on turn
         N+1. That makes ``state.document_ids`` ONE TURN BEHIND, so
         we read it last as a fallback only.

    Earlier order (state ahead of forwardedProps) caused the Bug-2026-04-28
    multi-doc regression: user opened doc 2 mid-session; backend kept
    seeing only doc 1's id because state had `[doc1]` from the prior
    turn's STATE_SNAPSHOT and forwardedProps was never consulted.
    See backend.log line ``WARNING:adk.callbacks:doc loader: turn start
    — document_ids=['6ecff3e0...']`` and the corresponding frontend
    console line showing ``includedDocIds= ["6ecff3e0...", "41ea1884...",
