"""Every /api/admin route is scope-gated — enforced, not documented (M5).

This is the mechanism that keeps the tenant boundary true *as routes are
added*. v6.9.0 shipped a correct tenant-admin role with exactly one call site
because nothing forced the other twenty routes to use it. A checklist in a
design doc does not survive six months of feature work; a failing test does.

The suite has two halves:

  1. **Static coverage** — enumerate every route on every admin router by
     introspecting ``router.routes``, and assert each one either depends on the
     shared scope dependency or is on a short, *reasoned* exemption list. A new
     unscoped admin route fails here on the day it is written, without anyone
     remembering to add a test for it.

  2. **Behavioural matrix** — for the routes that take a domain-ish key, drive a
     real request as ``tenant-admin:a.com`` against ``b.com`` data and assert a
     403 / empty result. Static coverage proves the dependency is wired;
     this proves it is actually consulted.
