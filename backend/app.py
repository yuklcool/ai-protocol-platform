"""
Aitana Platform v6 — Root agent definition.

This is the ADK agent entry point. The ADK framework discovers this file
and creates the agent + app from it.

Individual skills create sub-agents; this root agent delegates to them.

Workshop W2a — ADK: The Foundation
  The entire agent is declared here: a name, a model, an instruction, and a
  tool list. No orchestration loop, no retry logic, no token counting. ADK
  handles all of that. Sub-agents are populated at runtime from Firestore
  skill configs via the factory in adk/agent.py (W2b).

    # computed for a 1M-token Gemini window, whatever model it actually ran. A
    # Claude skill on a ~200K window got the 1M settings. `get_compaction_config`
    # was correct and had never once been applied — the bug was here, at its one
    # call site. (2026-08-06 ONE UAT; see
    # docs/design/v6.23.0/conversation-context-fidelity.md.)

    # output, which compaction is not). Asserting Gemini here would fail the
    # import on an entirely valid deployment.
    #
    # This makes the App config track the COMMON case. A skill pinned to a
    # different family still runs under it — the App is global. Narrowing that
    # per-session is the remaining half; ADK 1.31.1 exposes the seam via
    # `invocation_context.events_compaction_config`, which the pre-request
    # token-threshold processor reads (the post-invocation sliding window still
    # reads the App). Tracked as Phase 2 in the design doc.
