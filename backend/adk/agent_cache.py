"""TTL + LRU cache for built agents (cold-start / per-turn build cost, v6.14.0).

``create_agent_with_thinking`` ran on EVERY chat turn with no cache — rebuilding
the model chain, all tools, every MCP toolset object (a Firestore read per
server), and recursively building every ``auto``-floor delegate. Measured warm
that's ~1.4s of ``before_agent`` per turn; on a cold instance it compounds with
process import into the ~25s first-request cost.

The built agent is a pure function of ``(skill, user, access)`` — session id,
message, and document ids all arrive at RUN time (via the Runner / initial_state),
never at build time. So it is cacheable. The cache key captures everything that
changes the built agent:

  * ``skill.skill_id`` + ``skill.updated_at`` — a Studio edit bumps ``updated_at``
    (and invalidates the skill_config cache), so an edited skill misses and
    rebuilds.
  * the ``AccessContext`` (frozen, hashable) — the agent bakes in per-user
    permission/loader callbacks AND its delegate set is access-filtered, so a
    different user, domain, or group-tag set must get its own agent. A mid-session
    group-tag grant changes the key → rebuild.

TTL (60s, matching ``skills.skill_config``) bounds staleness for anything not in
the key; an LRU cap bounds growth across (users x skills). A build error is never
cached. Concurrency: a race can double-build (harmless) — worst case is redundant
work, never a wrong agent, because the key fully determines correctness.
