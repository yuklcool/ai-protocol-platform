# Model-aware compaction config. See backend/config/models.yaml for the full
# model registry. EventsCompactionConfig lives on App, not Agent or Runner.
#
# COMPACTION IS LOSSY AND INVISIBLE — read this before tuning the numbers.
# When a compaction fires, ADK materialises a summary event and *filters the
# raw events out of the request sent to the model*
# (`flows/llm_flows/contents.py::_process_compaction_events`). The raw events
# stay in the session store, so the UI transcript, the Firestore mirror and the
# Activity tab all still show every turn — but the model can no longer see them,
# and has no way to reach back for them. A user watching a full transcript
# reasonably assumes the model sees it too.
#
# That is not hypothetical: at the 2026-08-06 ONE UAT a ~12-turn expert
# conversation compacted once at turn 10, and the "summarise everything we just
# worked out" payoff request produced the wrong material. See
# docs/design/v6.23.0/conversation-context-fidelity.md.
#
# TWO TRIGGERS, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE (verified on google-adk 1.31.1):
#
#   token_threshold      — fires on real context pressure. Checked pre-request by
#                          `CompactionRequestProcessor`
#                          (flows/llm_flows/compaction.py) off
#                          `invocation_context.events_compaction_config`, and
#                          again post-invocation inside
#                          `_run_compaction_for_sliding_window` off
#                          `app.events_compaction_config`. This is the trigger we
#                          want doing the work.
#   compaction_interval  — fires on a raw count of user turns, blind to their
#                          size. Checked post-invocation by the Runner
#                          (runners.py:622).
#
# Turn count is the wrong trigger on a 1M-token model: ten short clarifying
# turns might be 8K tokens, and discarding them buys nothing while losing
# exactly the detail the user spent those turns establishing. So the token
# threshold is the primary mechanism and the interval is a backstop, set high
# enough that it only catches pathological sessions (many huge turns that
# somehow never trip the token check).
#
# Thresholds are ~25% of the usable window: early enough that one large turn
# can't blow the context, late enough that a normal expert conversation never
# compacts at all.
#
# `event_retention_size` is REQUIRED whenever `token_threshold` is set (ADK's
# model validator rejects one without the other) and is the token-mode analogue
# of `overlap_size`: when token compaction fires, the last N *raw events*
# survive uncompacted. Note events, NOT turns — one turn is several events
# (user message, tool call, tool response, model reply), so a tool-heavy turn
# can be 4-5 events on its own. These are set generously because this is
# precisely the "what does the model still remember verbatim" knob.
#
# NOTE: gpt-5.4 must come before gpt-5 so the more-specific prefix wins.

#     tail    3,141 -> 31,330 ms   (+28.2s, paid after it finishes)
#     worst turn: 90s total. And EVERY compacting turn compacted TWICE.
#
# Twice, because ADK runs two independent compaction paths and both fired:
#
#   pre-request       CompactionRequestProcessor, off invocation_context
#                     -> lands squarely in TTFT: the user stares at nothing
#                        while we summarise a conversation they can already see
#   post-invocation   Runner, off app.events_compaction_config
#                     -> runs at the END of a turn, i.e. exactly when the user
#                        starts reading. Already anticipatory, and free if we
#                        stop blocking on it.
#
# They read DIFFERENT config objects (verified on google-adk 1.31.1), which is
# the whole trick: raise the threshold on the per-invocation copy and the
# pre-request path stops firing, while the App-level config keeps the
# post-invocation path doing the routine work.
#
# The pre-request path is NOT disabled — it is the safety net that stops a turn
# exceeding the model's context window, and a failed turn is worse than a slow
# one. It is moved to a level only a genuinely at-risk turn reaches, so the user
# waits only when the alternative is an error.
#
# DERIVED FROM THE MODEL'S REAL WINDOW, not a multiple of the routine threshold.
# The first cut used `routine * 3` and it FAILED IN MEASUREMENT: a relative
# threshold moves with the routine one, so once a conversation is big enough it
# crosses both and the pre-request path fires again. Live run, 2026-08-06:
# turn 15 compacted once with TTFT at baseline (the fix working), turn 16
# compacted twice with TTFT +14s (the fix defeated). "Emergency" has to be an
