"""AG-UI / ADK glue for the skill streaming endpoint.

`ag_ui_adk.ADKAgent` already converts ADK events to AG-UI events (its
1.3kloc `event_translator.py` handles the full mapping). Rolling our own
translator just to re-emit the same SSE sequence would duplicate that
work and drift against upstream. Instead this module does the three
things the library does *not* do:

  * `build_agui_adk_agent(agent, ...)` — wraps an ADK agent with platform
    defaults (``app_name``, the three real backing services from
    ``adk.session``, thread-id-as-session-id) so the skill processor gets
    a ready-to-run bridge.
  * `stream_agui_events(agui_agent, run_input)` — serializes each AG-UI
    event to a JSON-safe dict (what the SSE layer writes to the wire).
  * **Terminal-event deduplication (G41 — template-agui-terminal-dedup.md):**
    when a tool call raises mid-stream, ``ag_ui_adk`` (per its current
    1.x line) can emit RUN_ERROR via the queue-based background path
    AND THEN fall through to a RUN_FINISHED emission in the surrounding
    try-block. @ag-ui/client's state machine correctly rejects the
    duplicate terminal event with "Cannot send event type 'RUN_FINISHED':
    The run has already errored". ``stream_agui_events`` enforces the
    spec invariant — at most ONE terminal event per run — by tracking
    whether we've already yielded RUN_ERROR/RUN_FINISHED and dropping
    any subsequent terminal events with a warning log. Surfaced by
    the gde-ap-agent fork (2026-06-06) during a long tool-throw demo.

Design reconciliation (2026-04-21): the AGENT-FACTORY sprint plan called
for a `_to_agui_event(adk_event)` helper "moved from the spike". The
spike used the library, not a hand-rolled translator, so there is no
such logic to move. The library boundary — `ADKAgent.run()` — is where
this module integrates instead.

    keep working unchanged.

    ``user_id`` MUST be the authenticated Firebase uid in production paths
    (chat-history-deep-fixes-2 / 1.15). When omitted, ag_ui_adk falls back
    to a default extractor that derives the user_id from the AG-UI
    thread_id (``f"thread_user_{thread_id}"``). The Firestore
    ``chat_sessions/{id}.owner_uid`` is written from the Firebase uid, so
    the default extractor produces a Vertex session under a different
    user_id than the one we look it up by — every subsequent
    ``GET /api/sessions/{id}/messages`` then 500s with
    ``ValueError: Session ... does not belong to user``. Pass the Firebase

    # WHY: ag_ui_adk only sets its internal `_app` from `from_app()`. Built the
    # old way (`ADKAgent(adk_agent=...)`), `_app` stays None and `_create_runner`
    # takes the component branch — `Runner(app_name=…, agent=…)` with NO App. A
    # Runner with `app is None` disables both compaction triggers
    # (runners.py:622 and :1480 each guard on it), which is why the entire
    # tuning table in `adk/session.py` had never affected a chat turn. Measured:
    # 25 turns at compaction_interval=10 produced 0 compactions.
    #
    # The App we pass carries OUR per-skill agent as root, not the deployment's
    # global root agent. `from_app` does `cls(adk_agent=app.root_agent, ...)`,
    # so handing it the App unmodified would make every skill execute the global
    # root agent — the PPA expert, the doc comparer and the Studio copilot all
    # silently becoming the same generic assistant, with no error raised.

    # only reach `invocation_context.events_compaction_config` — the pre-request
