"""ADK callback hooks for the Aitana platform.

Callbacks wired into every skill by `adk.agent.create_agent`:
  * `before_tool_callback`   = `make_permission_enforcer(email, domain)`
  * `before_agent_callback`  = `make_before_agent(skill_id)` composed with
                               `make_session_tracker(owner_uid)` — the latter
                               creates/initialises the ChatSessionIndex on the
                               first turn of a new session.
  * `after_agent_callback`   = `make_after_agent_response(owner_uid)` — bumps
                               counters in the index and generates a title
                               after turn 2.
  * `after_tool_callback`    = `_handle_large_output`

`make_*` factories capture per-user context in closures to avoid threading
it through ADK session state.

Debounce: turnCount / lastMessageAt are flushed to Firestore every
`_TURN_FLUSH_INTERVAL` turns OR when the title needs to be set — keeps
Firestore QPS low during bursty agent loops.

    Why: ADK's standard ``load_artifacts_tool`` makes the agent decide
    whether to call it — and Gemini sometimes calls it with empty
    ``artifact_names``, in which case nothing actually reaches the model
    and the agent confidently says "you haven't provided a document".
    The user has *signalled* intent by attaching the document (clicking
    a doc tab, or resuming a thread that had docs attached), so we skip
    that gamble and put the blocks directly in the LLM request.

    Scope (chat-history-deep-fixes-3 / Bug F): fires whenever
    ``state[_STATE_DOCS_LOADED]`` is non-empty, regardless of whether
    the session is fresh or resumed. Earlier scope ("only resumed")
    was a conservative initial choice that left fresh chats relying on
    Gemini's flaky tool-discovery — the user reported the failure
    end-to-end ("the tool tries to load artifacts but doesn't see the
    doc") so we drop the gate.

    Per-turn behaviour: only fires for the first model call of each turn
    (when the trailing content is the user's text, not a tool
    function_response) so we don't re-inject during in-turn tool
    roundtrips. Each turn's request is rebuilt from session events, so
    we have to inject again on every user turn — the alternative

    None, OR returns a follow-up ``genai.types.Content`` event that ADK
    appends to the response stream. The bespoke ``_composed_after_agent``
    wrapper in agent.py was annotated ``-> None`` and silently discarded
    each callback's return value, so a callback that wanted to surface a
    Card (e.g. structured-extraction JSON Part) had no path to the wire.

    This helper restores ADK's "first non-None return is the follow-up"
    contract while composing N callbacks in order. Sync and async

        *callbacks: One or more after-agent callbacks. Order matters —
