"""Seed Firestore mcp_servers/ collection with MCP server configs.

Idempotent: re-running with the same args is safe (uses set with merge=False so
the document is replaced, not appended). Reads optional URL overrides from
flags so the same script seeds local-dev (localhost:3001) and deployed
(Cloud Run sidecar URL) without code changes.

Usage:
    # Local dev (default env: dev — points at localhost:3001/mcp)
    uv run python scripts/seed_mcp_servers.py

    # A DEPLOYED env (issue #14: test had never been seeded because this
    # script could only target dev — every env needs its own run, with the
    # env's own Cloud Run URL for ext-apps-map):
    uv run python scripts/seed_mcp_servers.py --env test \\
        --public-url https://mcp-ext-apps-map-<hash>-ew.a.run.app/mcp

    # Dry run
    uv run python scripts/seed_mcp_servers.py --env test --dry-run

The seeded server is then activated per-skill by adding its id to the
SkillConfig's tool_configs.mcp.servers list (handled by seed_skills.py
or the skill admin UI; not this script's concern). The set of ids this
script can seed MUST stay in sync with
admin.mcp_registry_check.KNOWN_SEEDABLE_SERVER_IDS — the post-seed
deploy gate and the PR-time unit test both pin against that set.

# MCP Toolbox (v6.14.0) — Google's database gateway, run as a SIDECAR container
# inside platform-frontend rather than as its own Cloud Run service.
#
# The URL is loopback in BOTH local dev and deployed, because a sidecar shares
# the instance's network namespace. That is the whole point: no per-env URL to
# drift (env_config_parity_not_in_code), no Cloud Run IAM hop, no ID token to
# mint or refresh, no cold start in the TTFT path. `headers` stays empty and
# there is NO auth block — the registry needs no new code to reach it.
#
# 127.0.0.1 (not `localhost`) for the same G42 reason as above: `localhost` can
# resolve to ::1 while the server binds IPv4, and the failure is a silent
# "MCP server returned no tools" at agent-run time.
#
# Toolbox's default port is 5000. The path is TOOLSET-SCOPED — /mcp/<toolset>
# serves only that toolset's tools, which is how a fork exposes a different
# per-client toolset without touching the registry.
# TOOLSET NAMES COME FROM THE SHIPPED CONFIG, not a constant here.
#
# TEMPLATE-INVERT M4 scrubbed the customer's toolset name to the generic
# `example` in this file, while the deployed sidecar kept serving the real
# toolset — so the registry pointed at a path Toolbox does not serve and the
# skills silently resolved to no tools. Third instance of the same class as
# ENTSOE_PROJECT and tools.yaml: a scrubbed value that was load-bearing.

# Maps Grounding Lite (v6.23.0 MAPS-GROUNDING) — Google's geospatial grounding
# service, reached as a plain remote MCP server.
#
# WHY THIS AND NOT ADK's `google_maps_grounding`: the native Vertex tool is
# contractually unavailable to us. Its terms read "Service not available for
# customers with billing addresses in the European Economic Area (EEA)", and
# Aitana Labs bills from the EEA. Grounding Lite is the path Google documents
# for EEA customers. Do NOT "simplify" this back to the built-in tool.
#
# Two structural bonuses over the native tool, both of which we'd otherwise pay
# for: it is an ordinary MCP toolset, so (a) it coexists with FunctionTools and
# needs no AgentTool sub-agent wrapper (the native built-in is a model-level tool
# that cannot share a request with function tools — see tools/search_agent.py),
# and (b) it works on Claude and OpenAI skill agents, not just Gemini.
#
# The API key rides as ${MAPS_GROUNDING_API_KEY} — a NAME, resolved from the
# environment at toolset-build time. Never write the key itself here; see
# "Secret-bearing headers" in tools/mcp/registry.py.
